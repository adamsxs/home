# Hello and Welcome!

My name's Sam Adams, and I'm a data scientist.
I got a taste of doing coding and simulation work while studying chemical engineering, and have since made the switch.
I started off teaching myself coding in Python after work and in my free time, and with the help of the folks at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) eventually leveled up to more comprehensive data science work.
You'll find repositories specifically for data science projects created while at Metis or afterwards, as well as some one-off work to beef up a skill or test out an idea.  

I've created this page as a quick guide to navigating my Github.
There are links below to some relevant projects, but if you can't find what you're looking for feel free to reach out over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psamueladams/).
Whether for professional stuff or just to shoot the breeze about soccer, I welcome the feedback on my work or links to relevant resources. 

Thanks for stopping by,  
Sam

## Data Science Projects:
All projects listed below cover the machine learning process, from gathering and exploring the data to interpreting how the model results apply to the use case.
I've included the main model category in the title, but there are plenty of more subtle techniques at work in each project.  
[Predicting Hurricane Damage Costs using NOAA Data: linear regression](https://github.com/adamsxs/metis_project_02)  
[Detecting Air Pressure System Failure in Scania Trucks: classification](https://github.com/adamsxs/metis_project_03)  
[Identifying Hate Speech on Twitter: NLP, topic modeling, classification](https://github.com/adamsxs/metis_project_04_NLP)  
[Detecting Cyberattacks in the UNSW-NB15 Dataset: classification, anomaly detection, and clustering](https://github.com/adamsxs/metis_project_05_anomaly_detection)
